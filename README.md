🛡️ Privacy & Security

Neatify is open-source. It never accesses your personal files, browser history, or passwords. It only targets temporary cache files and organizes files on your desktop based on extensions.

    Note on Antivirus: Since the app interacts with system folders and is packaged as an EXE, some antivirus software might flag it as a "False Positive." This is common with PyInstaller/Nuitka projects. You can inspect the source code here to ensure its safety.
